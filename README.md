# BANK-LOAN-CASE-STUDY
In this project, we have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Bank Loan Dataset. This
case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. The loanproviding companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their insufficient or nonexistent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming
defaulters.  

**Business Understanding:**  

The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient
or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by
becoming a defaulter.  

Suppose we work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types
of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data.
This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.  

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan
approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s
decision:  
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss
of business to the company.  
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then
approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.  

When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by
the client/company:  
1. **Approved**: The company has approved loan application
2. **Cancelled**: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the
client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the
client he received worse pricing which he did not want.
3. **Refused:** The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their
requirements etc.).
4. **Unused Offer:** Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the
process.  
In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes
influence the tendency of default. 

From this project, we have to discover some insights such as-
- Which type of applicants are likely to pay the loan amount and which type of applicants
are taking advantage of the loan amount?
- Identifying such defaulters and taking strict actions like denying the loan, reducing the
amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will
ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
- Presenting approach of removing non-useful columns, and null values, identifying
outliers and data imbalance in the data, explaining the results of univariate,
segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, etc. in business terms.  
- Drawing out top 10 correlation for the client with payment difficulties and all other cases.  
- Discovering such results by performing EDA to help the company to decide whether to
approve or refuse the loan application.
